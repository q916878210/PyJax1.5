# PyJax1.5

PyJax is a web hosting and compilation framework.

PyJax was created to make web development modular.  Content and resources are automatically gathered and assembled.  Get/Post requests can be handled with html and/or Python methods.

The framework is data friendly.  Built-in scripts take care of site navigation.

Forward/backward navigation with the browser triggers content to load asynchronously.


PyJax runs on OSX/Windows/Linux (including Raspberry pi) with Python 2.7 installed.
