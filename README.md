# PyJax1.5

PyJax is a web hosting and compilation framework designed to make web development modular.
Content and resources are automatically gathered and assembled.
Get/Post requests can be handled with html and/or Python methods.

PyJax runs on OSX/Windows/Linux (including Raspberry pi) with Python 2.7 installed.

A complete how-to will come soon.
